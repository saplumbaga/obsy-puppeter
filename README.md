# Obsy Puppeteer Tool

This is a minimal **browser automation microservice** built using [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/) and Node.js, designed as part of the [Observer](https://siteobserver.co) project.

It runs a headless Chromium instance inside a Docker container, loads a web page, collects timing metrics, page title, and HTML size, and returns the result as JSON via a simple HTTP API.

## üîç Features

- Launches Chromium in headless mode
- Accepts a `url` via query string
- Returns:
  - HTTP status code
  - Page title
  - Total page size
  - Navigation timing metrics (from `performance.getEntriesByType("navigation")`)
  - Transfer size of all resources
  - Captures JavaScript errors and failed requests
